## Releasing Editor

- CHANGELOG.md (required)
- README.md (if needed)

### 3. Push them to `build/release-x.x.x` branch and test the built packages for each platform

Pushing to `build/*` branch runs a job to build the package. Make sure that the built packages for each platform work properly. You can download the packages from the artifact of the build. For more information, see [Build workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml).

### 4. Create pullrequest

If there is no problem, create a pullrequest.
